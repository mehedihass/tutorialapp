		<h1>Intro to SQL</h1>
		<p>SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This tutorial will give you a quick start to SQL. It covers most of the topics required for a basic understanding of SQL and to get a feel of how it works.</p>

	<h1>Prerequisite</h1>
		<p>Before you start practicing with various types of examples given in this tutorial, I am assuming that you are already aware about what a database is, especially the RDBMS and what is a computer programming language.</p>
	<h1>Applications of SQL</h1>
	<p>As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases. I'm going to list few of them here:
